git4go
==========

Pure Golang implementation of git repository operation library. It has as same API as [git2go](https://github.com/libgit2/git2go) - ([libgit2](https://libgit2.github.com) wrapper for Golang).

License
============

``git4go`` is under GPL2 **with linking exception**. This is a translation of libgit2 and it uses same license.

This means you can link to and use the library from any program, proprietary or open source; paid or
gratis.  However, you cannot modify git4go and distribute it without supplying the source.

See the COPYING file for the full license text.

GPLv2 specifies "translation to other language" means "modification", so I have to use GPLv2 in my understanding (if not, I want to move LGPLv3 or something).
